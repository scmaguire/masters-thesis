	Abstract = {The paper addresses a new approach to passive acoustic cloaking, which is an alternative to the well-known approach of transformation optics. It is shown first that the scattered acoustic field of a body is completely determined by special surface impedances defined at the body surface. The surface impedances of a non-scattering, i.e. acoustically transparent, body of any geometry are then derived explicitly, and a thin coating is proposed that can provide such impedances with controlled accuracy. The coating represents a doubly periodic surface structure made of elements of sub-wavelength size. The computer simulation shows that the coating being placed on any body can render it non-scattering and, hence, invisible to all acoustic observation systems in a range of low and medium frequencies. The width of the range and the coating efficiency depend on the number of internal couplings introduced between the coating elements.},

	Abstract = {A new theoretical solution to the problem of scattering sound by arbitrary obstacles in a fluid medium is presented. The scattering matrices are expressed in terms of three input impedance matrices defined with respect to the fluid{\^a}€``scatterer interface: one impedance matrix describes the scatterer and two matrices characterize the fluid. General properties of the scattering matrices are studied. Some useful representations of the scattered field are proposed. The general solution is applied to three well-known practical problems for which some new results are obtained or the existing results are generalized. For the first problem (of the most efficient passive sound absorber), an equation that determines its surface impedances is derived. A similar result is obtained for the second problem (of the best scatterer). For the third problem (of how to make a body to be acoustically transparent), {\^a}€{\oe}active{\^a}€ solutions that can be realized as smart coatings are proposed.

	Abstract = {In this review, we give a brief introduction to the application of the new technique of transformation acoustics, which draws on a correspondence between coordinate transformation and material properties. The technique is formulated for both acoustic waves and linear liquid surface waves. Some interesting conceptual devices can be designed for manipulating acoustic waves. For example, we can design acoustic cloaks that make an object invisible to acoustic waves, and the cloak can either encompass or lie outside the object to be concealed. Transformation acoustics, as an analog of transformation optics, can go beyond invisibility cloaking. As an illustration for manipulating linear liquid surface waves, we show that a liquid wave rotator can be designed and fabricated to rotate the wave front. The acoustic transformation media require acoustic materials which are anisotropic and inhomogeneous. Such materials are difficult to find in nature. However, composite materials with embedded sub-wavelength resonators can in principle be made and such 'acoustic metamaterials' can exhibit nearly arbitrary values of effective density and modulus tensors to satisfy the demanding material requirements in transformation acoustics. We introduce resonant sonic materials and Helmholtz resonators as examples of acoustic metamaterials that exhibit resonant behaviour in effective density and effective modulus.},

	Abstract = {A complete analysis of coordinate transformations in elastic media by Milton et al has shown that, in general, the equations of motion are not form invariant and thus do not admit transformation-type solutions of the type discovered by Pendry et al for electromagnetics. However, in a two-dimensional (2D) geometry, the acoustic equations in a fluid are identical in form to the single polarization Maxwell equations via a variable exchange that also preserves boundary conditions. We confirm the existence of transformation-type solutions for the 2D acoustic equations with anisotropic mass via time harmonic simulations of acoustic cloaking. We discuss the possibilities of experimentally demonstrating acoustic cloaking and analyse why this special equivalence of acoustics and electromagnetics occurs only in 2D.},

	Abstract = {Transformation acoustics opens a new avenue towards the design of acoustic metamaterials, which are materials engineered at the subwavelength scale in order to mimic the parameters in wave equations. The design of the acoustic cloaking is based on the property of equations being invariant under a coordinate transformation, i.e. a specific spatial compression is equivalent to a variation of the material parameters in the original space. In this paper, the sound invisibility performance is discussed for spherical cloaks. The original domain consists of alternating concentric layers made from piezoelectric ceramics and epoxy resin, following a triadic Cantor sequence. The spatial compression, obtained by applying the concave-down transformation, leads to an equivalent domain with an inhomogeneous and anisotropic distribution of the material parameters.},

	Abstract = {Andrew N Norris*Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Rutgers UniversityPiscataway, NJ 08854-8058, USA (norris{at}rutgers.edu)AbstractAn acoustic cloak is a compact region enclosing an object, such that sound incident from all directions passes through and around the cloak as though the object was not present. A theory of acoustic cloaking is developed using the transformation or change-of-variables method for mapping the cloaked region to a point with vanishing scattering strength. We show that the acoustical parameters in the cloak must be anisotropic: either the mass density or the mechanical stiffness or both. If the stiffness is isotropic, corresponding to a fluid with a single bulk modulus, then the inertial density must be infinite at the inner surface of the cloak. This requires an infinitely massive cloak. We show that perfect cloaking can be achieved with finite mass through the use of anisotropic stiffness. The generic class of anisotropic material required is known as a pentamode material (PM). If the transformation deformation gradient is symmetric then the PM parameters are explicit, otherwise its properties depend on a stress-like tensor that satisfies a static equilibrium equation. For a given transformation mapping, the material composition of the cloak is not uniquely defined, but the phase speed and wave velocity of the pseudo-acoustic waves in the cloak are unique. Examples are given from two and three dimensions.Keywords: cloakingpentamodeanisotropyFootnotesElectronic supplementary material is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2008.0076 or via http://journals.royalsociety.org.Received February 24, 2008.Accepted April 1, 2008.{\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society},

VerrierDefence Science and Technology Laboratory, Porton Down, Salisbury SP4 0JQ, UK{\^a}†µ*Author for correspondence (jdsmith{at}dstl.gov.uk).Abstract The effect of a non-zero shear modulus on two-dimensional acoustic cloaking based on the transformation technique is investigated. Using the method of multiple scales, approximate solutions are found to the elastic equations with anisotropic density when the ratio of the shear modulus to the bulk modulus is small. These solutions indicate that a non-zero shear modulus causes the cloaking effect to become limited to a band of frequency, which becomes wider as the shear modulus is reduced. Resonances associated with shear waves are seen in the tangential component of displacement but do not affect the scattering to first order in the asymptotic expansions. No finite solutions exist for the case when the transformation shrinks the cloaked object to zero size (perfect cloaking). cloakingelasticitymultiple scalesReceived December 10, 2010.Accepted January 21, 2011.This journal is {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society},

	Abstract = {We propose a general methodology and a set of practical recipes for the construction of ultra-broadband acoustic cloaks{\^a}€''structures that can render themselves and a concealed object undetectable by means of acoustic scattering. The acoustic cloaks presented here are designed and function analogously to electromagnetic cloaks. However, acoustic cloaks in a fluid medium do not suffer the bandwidth limitations imposed on their electromagnetic counterparts by the finite speed of light in vacuum. In the absence of specific metamaterials having arbitrary combinations of quasi-static speed of sound and mass density, we explore the flexibility of continuum transformations that produce approximate cloaking solutions. We show that an imperfect, eikonal acoustic cloak (that is, one which is not impedance matched but is valid in the geometrical optics regime) with negligible dispersion can be designed using a simple layered geometry. Since a practical cloaking device will probably be composed of combinations of solid materials rather than fluids, it is necessary to consider the full elastic properties of such media, which support shear waves in addition to the compression waves associated with the acoustic regime. We perform a systematic theoretical and numerical investigation of the role of shear waves in elastic cloaking devices. We find that for elastic metamaterials with Poisson's ratio {\^I}½>0.49, shear waves do not alter the cloaking effect. Such metamaterials can be built from nearly incompressible rubbers (with {\^I}½{\^a}‰ˆ0.499) and fluids. We expect this finding to have applications in other acoustic devices based on the form-invariance of the scalar acoustic wave equation.},
