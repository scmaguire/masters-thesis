	Abstract = {The sound absorption of an industrial waste, developed during the processing of tea leaves has been investigated. Three different layers of tea-leaf-fibre waste materials with and without backing provided by a single layer of woven textile cloth were tested for their sound absorption properties. The experimental data indicate that a 1 cm thick tea-leaf-fibre waste material with backing, provides sound absorption which is almost equivalent to that provided by six layers of woven textile cloth. Twenty millimeters thick layers of rigidly backed tea-leaf-fibres and non-woven fibre materials exhibit almost equivalent sound absorption in the frequency range between 500 and 3200 Hz. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Measurements of the acoustic surface impedance of a carpet and a sheet of glass wool were performed using this method in an anechoic room, in a small non-anechoic room, and in a large cafeteria. For strongly absorbing materials, the surface impedance measurements can be performed with this method in small or large non-anechoic rooms. For weakly-absorbing materials, measurements are possible for medium and high frequencies in either a large room or an anechoic room, but in a small non-anechoic room.},

	Abstract = {For locally reacting materials with a constant surface impedance, a classical method based on the work of Chien and Soroka [J. Sound Vib. 43, 9-20 (1975)] for measuring this impedance in situ around grazing incidence is currently used. A generalization of this work to include thin nonlocally reacting materials with a surface impedance noticeably dependent on the angle of incidence is performed. It is shown that the model by Chien and Soroka can be used, though the constant surface impedance must be replaced by the impedance at grazing incidence for the evaluation of the numerical distance. Measurements performed on a thin porous layer using this method are compared with measurements performed using the near-field acoustical holography method [M. Tamura, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 88, 2259-2264 (1990)]. Other measurements performed on a fibrous layer are in good agreement with the predicted values of the impedance at grazing incidence.},

@article{Bohne2007,
	Abstract = {Using morphological criteria, death pathways in outer hair cells (OHCs) were determined in chinchilla organs of Corti that had been exposed to a high- or moderate-level octave band of noise (OBN) centered at either 0.5 or 4-kHz. The specimens were part of our large collection of plastic-embedded flat preparations of chinchilla cochleae. Three death pathways were identified: (1) oncotic - swollen, pale-staining cell with a swollen nucleus, (2) apoptotic - shrunken, dark-staining cell with a pyknotic nucleus and (3) a newly defined third pathway - no basolateral plasma membrane but cellular debris arranged in the shape of an intact OHC with a nucleus deficient in nucleoplasm. To minimize the secondary loss of OHCs from the entrance of endolymph into the organ of Corti, the specimens used for quantitative analysis of death pathways had the following characteristics: (1) the level to which they were exposed was less than or equal to 95 dB SPL, (2) the exposure duration was 6-216 h, (3) fixation for microscopic examination took place in vivo 1-2 h post-exposure and (4) there were no focal OHC lesions in the organs of Corti. Fifty-eight noise-exposed cochleae met these criteria. In these specimens, degenerating and missing OHCs were classified as to which death pathway the cells had followed or were following. Nine non-noise-exposed cochleae were also evaluated for OHC death pathways. The number of OHCs following the third death pathway was significantly greater in the noise-exposed cochleae than the non-noise-exposed cochleae for total exposure energies greater than those produced by 75 dB SPL for 216 h to a 0.5-kHz OBN and 57 dB SPL for 48 h to a 4-kHz OBN. In cochleae exposed to either octave band, OHCs dying by oncosis or apoptosis were uncommon. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Acoustic measurements performed on non-spherical granular mixtures with different states of consolidation suggest that their acoustic performance can be related to that measured in loose granular mixes. It was found that the non-acoustic parameters of the pore size distribution, porosity, tortuosity and flow resistivity are highly sensitive to the median grain size in the mix, the compaction ratio and the binder content. The effects of these parameters on the acoustic properties have been investigated for a number of loose and consolidated samples with different grain sizes. Several established models for the acoustic properties of rigid-frame porous media have been tested. It is shown that some models can fail to predict accurately the acoustic properties of these materials and can require considerable adjustment of the input parameters. In this respect, the experimental results are of importance in the development of a scientific methodology for the design of granular absorbers with good acoustic efficiency and sound mechanical properties. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Acoustical porous materials like polymer foams or mineral wools are widely used in noise and vibration control. The acoustic efficiencies of these materials may be influenced by their elastic and damping properties. It is thus important to determine parameters such as Young's or shear moduli, Poisson's ratios and loss factors. The first objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive list of current available techniques and difficulties faced in the estimations of the elastic and damping parameters for acoustical porous materials. The second objective is to apply the maximum number of these methods to the characterization of a porous material and to discuss the results. In a first part, a brief recall of the mechanical behaviors of acoustical porous materials is given. This part includes a discussion on the influence of viscoelasticity and anisotropy often observed in porous materials. A description of experimental methods used for the elastic and damping characterizations of acoustical porous materials is also given. In total, three groups of quasistatic methods and six groups of dynamic methods are presented. Their main advantages and drawbacks are reported and discussed. In a second part, five of the presented methods are applied to a melamine foam to investigate the frequency and temperature dependences of its elastic and damping parameters. Characterization results are compared and discussed. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Lot of research is going on in developing materials suitable for absorbing sound and reducing noise. By virtue of their superior vibration damping capability and attractive characteristics such as visco elasticity, simple processing and commercial availability polyurethane foams are extensively applied not only in automotive seats but also in various acoustical parts. However, the sound absorption coefficient of polyurethane foams is high (0.8 -- 1.0) in high frequencies ranging from 300 to 10000Hz while it is found to be low (0 to 0.5) at low frequencies (10 to 200 Hz). In this study new polyurethane based porous composites were synthesized by in situ foam rising polymerization of polyol and diisocyanate in the presence of fillers such as nano silica, crumb rubber and nano clay. The effect of these fillers at various concentrations up to 2\% was studied on sound absorption characteristics, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. Sound absorption coefficient was determined using standing wave sound impedance tube method. The sound absorption coefficient of filled PU foams is found to be increasing from 0.5 to 0.8 with increasing frequency from 100 to 200 Hz at higher content of the fillers employed. In addition to enhanced sound absorption properties in low frequency region, the composite foams exhibit superior thermal and mechanical properties. Further foam cell structure and size determined by using SEM and its effect on various properties will also be highlighted.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes an alternative displacement formulation of Biot's linear model for poroelastic materials. Its advantage is a simplification of the formalism without making any additional assumptions. The main difference between the method proposed in this paper and the original one is the choice of the generalized coordinates. In the present approach, the generalized coordinates are chosen in order to simplify the expression of the strain energy, which is expressed as the sum of two decoupled terms. Hence, new equations of motion are obtained whose elastic forces are decoupled. The simplification of the formalism is extended to Biot and Willis thought experiments, and simpler expressions of the parameters of the three Biot waves are also provided. A rigorous derivation of equivalent and limp models is then proposed. It is finally shown that, for the particular case of sound-absorbing materials, additional simplifications of the formalism can be obtained.},

	Abstract = {Sound propagation in rigid-frame porous materials is governed by the effective density and the effective bulk modulus of the fluid in the pore space. These quantities, for which analytical expressions have already been derived by other researchers, are frequency-dependent, complex and non-linear. However, because of the complexity of these expressions, it is difficult to obtain physical insight into the acoustic behaviour of the porous materials and to determine the dominant mechanism for sound absorption for a given material at a given frequency. Alternatively there are very simple expressions. In this paper the relationships between the complicated and relatively simple models are studied, and simple non-dimensional expressions for the characteristic impedance and wavenumber for sound propagation in rigid-frame porous materials are derived using the concepts of acoustic mass, stiffness and damping. An upper bound for thermal losses in a rigid-frame material is presented, and a simple rule of thumb is given for the required flow resistivity, porosity and tortuosity for a given thickness of porous material. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The goal of this work is to study a model of the wave equation with semilinear porous acoustic boundary conditions with nonlinear boundary/interior sources and a nonlinear boundary/interior damping. First, applying the nonlinear semigroup theory, we show the existence and uniqueness of local in time solutions. The main difficulty in proving the local existence result is that the Neumann boundary conditions experience loss of regularity due to boundary sources. Using an approximation method involving truncated sources and adapting the ideas in Lasiecka and Tataru (1993) [28], we show that the existence of solutions can still be obtained. Second, we prove that under some restrictions on the source terms, then the local solution can be extended to be global in time. In addition, it has been shown that the decay rates of the solution are given implicitly as solutions to a first order ODE and depends on the behavior of the damping terms. In several situations, the obtained ODE can be easily solved and the decay rates can be given explicitly. Third, we show that under some restrictions on the initial data and if the interior source dominates the interior damping term and if the boundary source dominates the boundary damping, then the solution ceases to exists and blows up in finite time. Moreover, in either the absence of the interior source or the boundary source, then we prove that the solution is unbounded and grows as an exponential function. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Three solvents, that is, acetone, acetic acid, and dimethylacetamide (DMAc), with a range of solubility parameter $\delta$, surface tension $\gamma$, viscosity $\eta$ and boiling temperature were used to generate mixtures for electrospinning cellulose acetate (CA) (degree of substitution, DS = 2.45). Although none of these solvents alone enables continuous formation of fibers, mixing DMAc with either acetone or acetic acid produced suitable solvent systems. The 2:1 acetone:DMAc mixture is the most versatile mixture because it allows CA in the 12.5--20\% concentration range to be continuously electrospun into fibrous membranes. These CA solutions have $\eta$ between 1.2 and 10.2 poise and $\gamma$ around 26 dyne/cm and produce smooth fibers with diameters from 100 nm to ∼1 $\mu$m. Fiber sizes generally decrease with decreasing CA concentrations. The nature of the collectors affects the morphology as well as packing of fibers. Fibers collected on paper have more uniform sizes, smooth surfaces, and fewer defects, whereas fibers collected on water are more varied in size. Electrically conductive solid collectors, such as Al foil and water, favor more tightly packed and less porous membranes. Porous collectors, like paper and copper mesh, produce highly porous membranes. The pores in membranes collected on the Al foil and paper are much better interconnected in the planar directions than those in membranes collected on water. There is evidence that electrospinning induces order in the fibers. Deacetylation of CA membranes is more efficient and complete in NaOH/ethanol than in aqueous NaOH, producing DS values between 0.15 and 2.33 without altering fiber surfaces, packing, or organization. The fully regenerated cellulose membranes are similarly hydrophilic as commodity cellulose fibrous matrices but absorb nearly 10 times as much water. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {We have demonstrated nanofabrication with commercialized cellulose acetate. Cellulose acetate is used for bulk nanofabrication and surface nanofabrication. In bulk nanofabrication, cellulose acetate reacts with an e-beam and permanent patterns are formed in it instead of being transferred to other substrates. We have studied the nano relief modulation performance of cellulose acetate before and after development. The depth of the nanopatterns is magnified after development, and is varied by exposing dosage and line width of the pattern. The thinnest 65 nm wide line is achieved in the bulk fabrication. We also demonstrate a binary phase Fresnel lens array which is directly patterned in a cellulose acetate sheet. Because of its unique mechanical and optical properties, cellulose is a good candidate for a template material for soft imprinting lithography. In the surface nanofabrication, cellulose acetate thin film spin-coated on silicon wafers is employed as a new resist for e-beam lithography. We achieved 50 nm lines with 100 nm pitches, dots 50 nm in diameter, and single lines with the smallest width of 20 nm. As a new resist of e-beam lithography, cellulose acetate has high resolution comparable with conventional resists, while having several advantages such as low cost, long stock time and less harmfulness to human health.},

	Abstract = {The acoustic structure and propagation of sound in highly porous, layered, fine fiber materials is examined. Of particular interest is the utilization of the Kozeny number for determining the static flow resistance and the static structure factor based on flow permeability measurements. In this formulation the Kozeny number is a numerical constant independent of volume porosity at high porosities. The other essential parameters are then evaluated employing techniques developed earlier for open cell foams. The attenuation and progressive phase characteristics in bulk samples are measured and compared with predicted values. The agreements on the whole are very satisfactory.},

	Abstract = {Tortuosity is an important parameter for the prediction of the acoustical properties of porous sound absorbing materials. The evaluation of tortuosity by resistivity measurements is now used in several laboratories, although this method presents several drawbacks. In particular, the complete saturation by a conducting fluid of a porous foam having a high flow resistivity is difficult to obtain without partially damaging the structure of the cells. A simple technique based on ultrasonic wavespeed measurements in a material saturated by air is described. This method has been used previously only for water or superfluid helium saturated materials.},

@article{Takahashi2002,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a method of theoretical treatment of acoustic coupling due to flexural vibration of perforated plates and plates of porous elastic materials. The analytical model is developed by introducing flow continuity at the plate surface in a spatially mean sense and air-solid interaction within the plate material. To demonstrate the method of application, some fundamental acoustic problems based on a classical thin-plate theory are analyzed and discussed in relation to the interactive effect of flexural vibration and plate permeability. For acoustic radiation from a vibrating plate excited by a harmonic point-force, the attenuation effect of power radiation appears at frequencies below the critical frequency of coincidence. In the problem of sound absorption of a perforated plate or a plate of porous elastic material backed by an air layer, as permeability decreases, the effect of plate vibration increases. For perforated absorber systems including plate vibration effects, the trend of variation from ordinary theory depends on plate thickness.},

@article{Rumpler2012,
	Abstract = {Structural-acoustic finite element models including three-dimensional (3D) modeling of porous media are generally computationally costly. While being the most commonly used predictive tool in the context of noise reduction applications, efficient solution strategies are required. In this work, an original modal reduction technique, involving real-valued modes computed from a classical eigenvalue solver is proposed to reduce the size of the problem associated with the porous media. In the form presented in this contribution, the method is suited for homogeneous porous layers. It is validated on a 1D poro-acoustic academic problem and tested for its performance on a 3D application, using a subdomain decomposition strategy. The performance of the proposed method is estimated in terms of degrees of freedom downsizing, computational time enhancement, as well as matrix sparsity of the reduced system.},

@article{Kook2014,
	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the enhancement of the damping ratio of a structure with embedded microbeam resonators in air-filled internal cavities. In this context, we discuss theoretical aspects in the framework of the effective modal damping ratio (MDR) and derive an approximate relation expressing how an increased damping due to the acoustic medium surrounding the microbeam affect the MDR of the macrobeam. We further analyze the effect of including dissipation of the acoustic medium by using finite element (FE) analysis with acoustic-structure interaction (ASI) using a simple phenomenological acoustic loss model. An eigenvalue analysis is carried out to demonstrate the improvement of the damping characteristic of the macrobeam with the resonating microbeam in the lossy air and the results are compared to a forced vibration analysis for a macrobeam with one or multiple embedded microbeams. Finally we demonstrate the effect of randomness in terms of position and size of microbeams and discuss the difference between the phenomenological acoustic loss model and a full thermoacoustic model.},
